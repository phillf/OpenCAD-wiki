5. Upload the Zip file to that location.
6. Return to where the Zip file is.
7. Extract the zip file.
8. Delete the zip file
9. Enter the OpenCAD folder and move all of the files to the location where you want the openCAD to be.
10. Delete the OpenCAD folder we moved all of the files from.
11. Download the OpenCAD_Initialization.sql file open it in notepad.
12. Go to your Cpanel and enter the MySQL Database Wizard.
13. Create the Database, it's user, and grant ALL PRIVILEGES. Make sure you take note of the FULL database name, username, and password. (This includes the letters and/or numbers and underscore before it.)
14. In the notepad, delete the first TWO lines and replace 'opencad' with your database username.
15. Go back to your Cpanel and go to phpMyAdmin.
16. Navigate to the SQL tab in phpMyAdmin.
17. Go to the notepad of OpenCad_Initialization.sql, right click & click Select All and then right click & click Copy.

22. Fill out the information for COMMUNITY_NAME, DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD.
23. Change the information for BASE_URL so there is a // in front and then the link to the location with the OpenCAD. For example, I have my OpenCAD at www.example.com/otherstuff/cad, I would put '//www.example.com/otherstuff/cad/'.
24. Go to your website and request access.
25. Go back to phpMyAdmin and then go to your database. Then go to the 'users' table. Take note of your user_id.
